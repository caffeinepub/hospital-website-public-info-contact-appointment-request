# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restyle the site to resemble a modern Kavurey Hospital-like design while keeping all existing pages, content, and behaviors unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Update global visual theme (colors, typography, spacing, and component styling) to a cohesive hospital-style look across all pages.
- Restyle the global header and footer to match the new theme while preserving existing nav items/links, sticky behavior, responsiveness, and current footer contents.
- Redesign the Home page section layouts/styling (Hero, Emergency, Core Services, Trust Signals, CTA) to better match the reference style without removing sections or changing their meaning; keep current CTAs/routes and ensure the existing hero image remains integrated.
- Adjust Tailwind theme tokens and global styles to support the new palette/typography consistently (including light/dark modes if dark mode remains enabled), without editing read-only UI component sources.

**User-visible outcome:** The website looks and feels like a modern hospital website with a refreshed, consistent theme and a redesigned Home page layout, while navigation, pages, text, links, and form behavior remain the same.
