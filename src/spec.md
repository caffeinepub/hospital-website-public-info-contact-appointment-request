# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the hospital website’s overall visual quality and polish across all public pages while keeping existing content meaning unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Apply a consistent visual design system (spacing, typography scale, section layout, and component styling) across Home, About, Services, Emergency, Contact, Appointments, and 404 pages.
- Standardize interactive component styling (cards, buttons, icons, forms) including consistent hover/active/focus states.
- Perform a responsive design pass for mobile, tablet, and desktop to prevent overflow, cramped layouts, and inconsistent padding/grids.
- Improve accessibility basics (visible focus styles, sufficient contrast, semantic headings/labels, proper button/link usage).
- Add and integrate high-quality, cohesive medical-themed static imagery, optimized for sharp display and used with correct aspect ratios and descriptive alt text.

**User-visible outcome:** The site looks modern and consistent across all pages and devices, feels more polished and accessible, and includes cohesive high-quality medical imagery without changing the meaning of the existing content.
