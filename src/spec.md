# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the “Mahalaxmi Health Care” branding by applying a newly redesigned logo across the site header/footer and updating the favicon + Apple touch icons to match.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the existing generated logo asset so the Site Header and Site Footer display the new “Mahalaxmi Health Care” logo.
- Update the existing generated favicon (32x32, 192x192) and Apple touch icon (180x180) files so they visually match the new logo while keeping the same filenames referenced by the HTML.

**User-visible outcome:** The site shows the new “Mahalaxmi Health Care” logo in the header and footer, and the browser tab/mobile shortcut icons reflect the updated branding.
